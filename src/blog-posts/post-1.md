Increased productivity is at the heart of what drives all development and increases in performance and profitability. A combination of intelligent planning and focused efforts, productivity is something that can be continuously improved.
Being more productive means you can get more out of each and every day. It means you can do more in less time and with less resources. It means you can become the most efficient and productive version of yourself so you can achieve things you once considered to be in the too hard basket.
